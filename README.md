# A PyTorch implementation of tiny SSD object detector
Tiny SSD is a single-shot detection deep convolutional neural network for real-time embedded object detection. 
It brings together the efficieny of Fire microarchitecture introduced in SqueezeNet and object detection performance of Single Shot Object Detector.
